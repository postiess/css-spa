## How it works

The sections with ```.section``` are targetted via CSS pseudo-selector ```:target``` to ```display:block``` otherwise they are hidden with ```display:none```.

The page sections have a higher z-index & are positioned absolute to appear above the home page content. Perhaps there is a cleaner solution?
